<p>This research provides conclusive evidence for parapsychological phenomena, including shared collective hallucinations, within the context of a colossalvast laboratory environment. Conducted by Sean Mascali PhD, this study demonstrates that such phenomena are empirically verifiable within a biocentric framework, which views consciousness and biological processes as central to understanding reality. The laboratory findings support the existence of phenomena such as teleportation, telekinesis, materialisation, shapeshifting, and invincibility with a particular focus on shared collective hallucinations—instances where multiple individuals experience and report identical perceptual events of objective reality. The study’s results underscore the validity of these phenomena across various contexts, reinforcing the scientific method perspective and contributing to the broader field of parapsychology. This research establishes a robust foundation for future investigations and applications in parapsychological studies.</p>
